# Donation_website
This is a payment intergration website made under the Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) from SPARKS FOUNDATION.<br><br>
This is the third task from the task list(#task3)<br><br>
There is a simple donate button on the home page which lands on a payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g.
credit card, Paypal, etc.<br>
Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.
